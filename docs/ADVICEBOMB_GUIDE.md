# ADVICE BOMB GUIDE — Review Gates

Do not merge if any are missing:
- ❌ Model without declared externalities/teleconnections.
- ❌ Readiness claim without evidence tier and receipts.
- ❌ Congruence score without method disclosure + calculator_ref.
- ❌ Coercive pattern without oversight hooks and proportionality test.
- ❌ Cross-domain change without supersession or rollback plan.

Reviewer quick-check:
- Edge canon respected? (docs/ONTOLOGY_CONSTITUTION.md)
- Evidence integrity fields present? (docs/EVIDENCE_STANDARD.md)
- R/M levels aligned with scope? (docs/READINESS_POLICY.md)
- Disclaimers + Warning Gate referenced in human assets?
