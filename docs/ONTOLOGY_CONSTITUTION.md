# Ontology Constitution

Layers (views over one graph):
- CoNeura (domains), CoDendra (dendrites), CoAxa (cross-cutting abstractions), CoClusta (patterns),
  CoSyna (synapses/edge semantics), CoNucla (nuclei/authority), CoMito (metabolism/energy/resources), CoTela (teleconnections/externalities).

URNs: `urn:cocivium:<layer>:<path>:v<semver>`
Edge canon: requires, aligns_with, satisfies, contradicts, supersedes, governed_by, evidenced_by, implements, measures_with,
migrates_from, relates_to, competes_with, substitutes_for, externalizes_to, coupled_with, powered_by, decided_by, moderated_by.

Synapse weights: strength, stability, uncertainty, with provenance + last-reviewed metadata.
