# Referencing & Mirroring

Use `references/catalog.yaml` for canonical citations (id, title, org, year, url, license, access).
The DO block fetches only open items; paywalled standards (e.g., ISO/IEC) are cataloged but not mirrored.
Each mirrored file gets a SHA-256 and is listed in `references/mirrors/checksums.json`. Cite by catalog id.
