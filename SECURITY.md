# Security Policy

- **Report privately**: open a Security Advisory or email maintainer listed in repo settings.
- **Disclosure window**: 45 days default, accelerated if active exploitation suspected.
- **Scope**: schemas, safety gates, congruence calculators, and any code that influences recommendations.
- **No weaponization**: do not submit exploit code that targets coercive patterns; include minimal PoC + mitigations.
- **Fix protocol**: patch on a short-lived branch, add tests, note risk classification and affected artifacts.
