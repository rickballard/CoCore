# CoCore — Advice Bomb v3 (Planning-Complete Drop)

This repository includes a planning-complete Advice Bomb for CoCore — a **graph-native, safety-first** best-practice
knowledge base for CoSuite (CoAgent, CoModules, etc.). This drop adds:

- A **global references catalog** (`references/catalog.yaml`) and a PS7 **DO block** (`tools/ps/DO-FetchReferences.ps1`)
  to mirror **openly accessible** standards locally under `references/mirrors/` (with SHA-256 receipts).
- Foundational planning docs: Charter & Red-Lines, Ontology Constitution, Evidence Standard, Readiness Policy,
  Teleconnections & Externalities Policy, CoerceScope Summary, Referencing guide.
- Congruence as a **first-class asset** (schema + calculator contract), standard human-asset header/footer flags.
- Safety gates (Disclaimers & WARNING_GATE), Governance roles (CoNucla), Synapse semantics (CoSyna).
- Connector catalog (CoCache, CoRef, CoAgent, RegTwin, MeritRank/RepTag, GIBindex/CoWords, Evidence, Jurisdiction overlays).

> To fetch open references locally, run:
> `pwsh ./tools/ps/DO-FetchReferences.ps1`
